Intructions to be followed for running RFCM3 algorithm are as follows:-

Step1- Untar all the files into one folder.

step2- Run the executable MASTERCODE as follows:-

./MASTERCODE

1.Enter number of samples in each data
2.Enter number of classes
3.Enter Name list file of miRNAs
4.Enter Name list file of Genes

./MASTERCODE 308 3 Names_ActualExpressed.miRNA Names.mRNA (as for the cervical cancer data under study)

Explanation for the inputs are as follows:-

1. Enter the number of samples present in expression files 
2. For finding relevance and functional similarity, the miRNA and mRNA expressions were descritized into 3 classes 0,1 and 2, 
   the classes here represent these 3 classes.
3. File containing list of names of mRNA
ARHGEF10L
HIF3A
RNF17
RNF10
RNF11
RNF13
GTF2IP1
4. File containing list of names of miRNA
hsa-mir-675
hsa-mir-660
hsa-mir-671
hsa-mir-615
hsa-mir-7-1
hsa-mir-126
hsa-mir-127
hsa-mir-874

Apart from the above input files following files should also be present in the same folder:-

1. Data.mRNA : this file should contain gene names in Rows and their expression in different samples in columns.

ARHGEF10L	10.529	9.918	8.492	8.716	9.653	9.148
HIF3A	        2.336	5.091	3.552	1.535	4.791	1.077
RNF17	        1.109	0	0	0	2.858	0
RNF10	        11.59	11.704	11.872	11.724	11.635	11.563
RNF11	        11.521	10.291	10.592	10.284	11.144	11.336
RNF13	        10.676	9.941	10.035	9.671	10.931	10.74
GTF2IP1	        12.071	12.036	11.854	11.034	12.581	12.291

2. Descritized_miRNA.txt : this file should contain samples in rows and descritized expression values for miRNAs in column.

0	2	2	2	2	2	0	1
1	1	1	1	2	1	2	1
2	0	1	1	1	2	0	2
0	2	1	0	1	0	0	2
2	2	2	2	2	2	2	0
1	2	2	1	2	2	2	2
1	1	1	1	2	1	2	1

3. TransposedData.mRNA : this file should contain mRNA expression matrix, where rows are samples and columns are mRNA.

10.529	2.336	1.109	11.59	11.521	10.676	12.071
9.918	5.091	0	11.704	10.291	9.941	12.036
8.492	3.552	0	11.872	10.592	10.035	11.854
8.716	1.535	0	11.724	10.284	9.671	11.034
9.653	4.791	2.858	11.635	11.144	10.931	12.581
9.148	1.077	0	11.563	11.336	10.74	12.291
9.23	7.667	0	12.012	10.65	9.396	13.057

Important * - The sequence of mRNAs and miRNAs should be same in all the files.
            - The name of the files should be exactly as mentioned.

OUTPUT - A file named Module.txt will be generated containing "n" number of modules having one miRNA and maximum of 50 mRNAs, 
         where n stands for number of miRNA given as input.

Step4 - By using the MISIM information for respective type of cancer networks can be generated using Cytoscape Tool.

MISIM.matrix and MISIM_interaction for_cytoscape.txt is provided here for Cervical Cancer.

step5 - Modules generated in Step 3 are merged accordingly by utilizing network information generated by Cytoscape.
